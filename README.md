# Refractor02
Resubmission of previous ticket
My first action was to semantify the html.
The title of the website added for Tabular identity, etc.
nav tag added for nav bar
The first section was missing an Id for nav button up top
The images needed alt tags to even get the first level of acessibility.
Each of the divs representing sections are switched to sections instead of divs.
There was an img endtag which isn't necessary and was inconsistent of the previous icon end tags.
The year updated.
